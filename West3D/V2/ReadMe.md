# Custom skirts for Voron V2 printers

## Nomenclature

  First three numbers denotes the size. Next is the skirt side, A or B, same as Voron naming.  Next is NonLED or LED.  

  LED types require three files: The skirt file, housing, and diffuser.  Make sure you get the correct sizes so they fit properly.
          
## Print settings

   2-4 perimeters, 0.4mm forced width... in other words, normal Voron print settings. 
   
## BOM

  All you really need is an RGB or green (WEST3D REPRESENT!) LED strip that's 10mm width.  Preferrably, a 60 LEDs/m strip.  For a 350/300 size skirt, you will need 10 LEDs.  250 size is in the works and this will be updated when I get that tested.
   
## LED Skirts Instructions

  LED skirts are designed to be used with standard RGB LED strips (10mm width) with 60 LEDs/m.  Of course, you are free to use whatever LED you can fit inside the house and as many or as few LEDs as you want.  Diffuser piece can be printed in white or translucent filament.  Your choice!  

### Assembly directions

#### Prepare the skirt

The main skirt piece is designed with a built in support.  Once printed, simply take needle nose plyers, grab a sharp, interior corner and rip it out.  Most of it should come out very easily.  Clean up the rest of the bridge strands with tweezers or your fingers if you can.  

#### Prepare the housing
Prepare the housing by either inserting the LED strip through the side hole from the outside or threading the wires through the side hole from the inside.  Either way works.  If you're inserting the LEDs in, it's easier to get all the LEDs in first before making the bends.  

The housing has printed position "brackets" to help keep the strip in place.  Fold and shape the LED strip as shown in the picture below.  There is a final bracket at the end of the strip to keep it from flopping around.

#### Final assembly

Insert the diffuser into the skirt, then insert the housing into the back of the skirt.  The pieces are made to fit snugly with a snapfit to keep it secure.  Removal of the housing is easy by squeezing top and bottom and pulling the bottom edge out.

Once assembled, all that's left is to control the LEDs as you like.  ENJOY!
