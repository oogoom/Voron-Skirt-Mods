### Nomenclature

  First three numbers denotes the size. Next is the skirt side, A or B, same as Voron naming.  Next is NonLED or LED.  

  LED types require three files: The skirt file, housing, and diffuser.  Make sure you get the correct sizes so they fit properly.
          
          
### LED Skirts

  LED skirts are designed to be used with standard RGB LED strips (10mm width) with 60 LEDs/m.  Of course, you are free to use whatever LED you can fit inside the house and as many or as few LEDs as you want.
