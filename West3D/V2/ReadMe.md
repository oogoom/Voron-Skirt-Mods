![350 Skirt A LED](https://github.com/oogoom/Voron-Skirt-Mods/blob/main/West3D/V2/West3DLED.png)

# Custom skirts for Voron V2.4r2 printers

## Nomenclature

  First three numbers denotes the size. Next is the skirt side, A or B, same as Voron naming.  Next is NonLED or LED.  

  LED types require three files: The skirt file, housing, and diffuser.  Make sure you get the correct sizes so they fit properly.  Housing and diffuser are for the full logo or the condensed logo.  Condensed logo is only for 250 size.
          
## Print settings

   2-4 perimeters, 0.4mm forced width... in other words, normal Voron print settings. 
   
## BOM

  All you really need is an RGB or green (WEST3D REPRESENT!) LED strip that's 10mm width.  Preferrably, a 60 LEDs/m strip.  For a 350/300 size skirt, you will need 10 LEDs.  250 size is in the works and this will be updated when I get that tested.
   
## LED Skirts Instructions

  LED skirts are designed to be used with standard RGB LED strips (10mm width) with 60 LEDs/m.  Of course, you are free to use whatever LED you can fit inside the housing and as many or as few LEDs as you want.  Diffuser piece can be printed in white or translucent filament.  Your choice!  

### Assembly directions

#### Prepare the skirt

The main skirt piece is designed with a built in support.  Once printed, simply take needle nose pliers, grab a sharp, interior corner and rip it out.  Most of it should come out very easily.  Clean up the rest of the bridge strands with tweezers or your fingers if you can.  

#### Prepare the housing
Prepare the housing by either inserting the LED strip through the side opening.  It is not necessary to use adehsives.  If your strip has pre-applied adhesive, it's recommended not to remove the backing, so you can adjust the bends.  You can use the adhesive if you like, but make the bends first.  If you're inserting the LEDs through the opening instead of the wiring, it's easier to get all the LEDs in first before making the bends.  

The housing has printed position "brackets" to help keep the strip in place.  Fold and shape the LED strip as shown in the picture below.  There is a final bracket at the end of the strip to keep it from flopping around.

#### Final assembly

Insert the diffuser into the skirt, then insert the housing into the back of the skirt.  The pieces are made to fit snugly with a snapfit to keep it secure.  Removal of the housing is easy by squeezing top and bottom and pulling the bottom edge out.

Once assembled, the logo portion should look like this:

And when lit up, will look like this:

### Optional

Depending on your choice of aesthetics, you can black out the diffuser by adding a 20% car window tint to the front of the diffuser.  The tint will not only black out the diffuser to give a nice uniform look to the skirt, but also add an additional layer of diffusion that makes the colors really POP when lit up.  Below is how it would look with window tint.
