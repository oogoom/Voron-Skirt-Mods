![v0 skirt](https://github.com/oogoom/Voron-Skirt-Mods/blob/main/West3D/V0/images/Front.JPG)

This is a modified skirt for the Voron V0.2 to include a stylized "3D" of the West3D logo.  Read the instructions carefully!  

IMPORTANT:  In order to use this skirt mod, there must be enough available space behind the skirt and the power supply.  You will need at least 6.5mm of space to install the LED housing without sliding the bottom panel out.  Once installed, you still need at least 3mm of space between the back of the skirt and the PSU.  In most cases, you can achieve this by moving your PSU a bit.  Of course, you can always print everything and see if you have enough space.  It's not much plastic after all.

## Required Printed Parts

- V0_LeftSkirt_3D.stl
- V0_Diffuser.stl
- V0_Mask.stl
- V0_Housing.stl (not shown above)

## Required LEDs

The LEDs used for this skirt are 2020 WS2812 RGB LEDs on a 2.6mm wide strip.  The 148 LEDS per 1100mm is what you want to give you 11 LEDs in the limited space.  The best place to purchase them is off Aliexpress [here](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804268655878.html?spm=a2g0o.order_detail.order_detail_item.3.12c3f19c69yvgm&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa).

## Printing Instructions

The skirt prints with a built in support and bridging to form the logo.  For best chance of success, it is recommended that the skirt be printed with FOUR perimeters.  The mask and housing can be printed with at least 2, though 4 is recommended.  Infill percentage should be at least 20%.

**IMPORTANT:** 
The diffuser must be printed with ONE perimeter and recommended to be in white for best diffusion.  Translucent might work too but may be too bright or allow LED hot spots.  

**ALSO IMPORTANT:**  
The housing must be printed in a DARK filament.  Black or gray preferred.  I have not tested all colors, but lighter, brighter colors will likely tint the lights and distort your colors.

## Installation

Using needle nose pliers or similar, remove the built in support of the skirt.  Simply grab a corner and pull it out.  It should come out easily.  Remove any remaining strands of filament to ensure as clean as possible surface for the diffuser.

You will need 11 LEDs on the strip.  Route them through the housing as shown in the photo below.  Each of the posts are placed to help keep the strip in place and should only hold the strip over unused pads.

- Install the skirt onto the extrusion by placing the screw into the skirt first, then using a ball end to tighten the screw.  It is a tight fit, but should be fairly easy.  
- Install the mask over the diffuser and insert it into the skirt using tweezers if you haven't moved your bottom panel.  
- Install the LED housing while making sure your wires are routing properly.  The housing should snap in fairly well. 

Then it's just a matter of connecting your wires up to your controller of choice and turn on the LEDs.  ENJOY!

Special thanks to Albe for helping me test everything and his suggestions to improve the design.
