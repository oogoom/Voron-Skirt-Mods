[v0 skirt](https://github.com/oogoom/Voron-Skirt-Mods/edit/main/West3D/V0/images/DSC_3191.jpg)

Print with Voron settings for best results.

Requires tuned bridging or it won't work.  The built in support prints a bridged platform for everything else to go on.  

Remove the interior portion of the print.  It should come out fairly easily, but could be difficult based on your printer's particular tolerances.

You will need the skirt piece, the diffuser, and the housing.  Diffuser is recommended to be printed in white or at least translucent.  Clear would be too bright, imo.

The housing is designed and tested for 60/m LED strip that is 10mm wide.  It I can take 4 LEDs, but you could use less.  It just won't be as bright.

## Installing the LEDS

1. Bend the LED strip into a circular shape that matches the housing.  
2. Slide the wires into the slot as you gently place the LED strip inside the housing as shown in the pictures below.  The bottom side of the strip should touch the bottom.
3. Connect to your MCU or whatever and light it up!



## Finish assembly.
1. Place the diffuser in the skirt.
2. Place the housing into the skirt piece.  It is a basic pressure fit.

ENJOY!

Let me know if there are any issues.
