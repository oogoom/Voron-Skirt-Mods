Modified West3D logo LED skirts for Voron Trident.

Follow the directions on the [v2 page](https://github.com/oogoom/Voron-Skirt-Mods/blob/main/West3D/V2/). NOTE: Housing should be printed in a DARK filament.  Black or gray is preferred.  Anything else may effect color reproduction and make the back of your skirts glow. 

Right side skirt will be uploaded soon with a fun design.  maybe.

below is a photo of the 250 trident left side skirt with LED illumination!
